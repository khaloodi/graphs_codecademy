"""
There are three main traversal orders that you’ll come across for graph traversal:

Preorder, in which each vertex is added to the “visited” list and added to the output list BEFORE getting added to the stack
Postorder, in which each vertex is added to the “visited” list and added to the output list AFTER it is popped off the stack
Reverse Post-Order (also known as Topological Sort), which returns an output list that is exactly the reverse of the post-order list
